0.9
======

* switch from requires to import for the d3.timeFormat dependency; bumping
  version just in the off-chance this causes explodes

0.8.4
======

* when converting a UTC datetime to string, respect the utc setting
  (previously ended up with local timezone)


0.8.3
======

* add .toJSON functions to all datetime objects so that JSON.stringify would
  convert respective datetime/date/time/timedelta to its string representation
  rather than an object. preferable as is more standard that a deserialized
  object

0.8.0
======

Reckon this one needs some sort of changelog entry.
When datetime is in UTC the strftime now returns the correct UTC representation
instead of reverting back to local timezone.
If your code relies on the previous interpretation, you can just wrap the utc
date in a new datetime object and lose the utc flag, like this:

```
- utc_dt.strftime
+ dt.datetime(utc_dt).strtfime
```
