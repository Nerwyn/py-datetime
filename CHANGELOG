0.8.0
======

Reckon this one needs some sort of changelog entry.
When datetime is in UTC the strftime now returns the correct UTC representation
instead of reverting back to local timezone.
If your code relies on the previous interpretation, you can just wrap the utc
date in a new datetime object and lose the utc flag, like this:

```
- utc_dt.strftime
+ dt.datetime(utc_dt).strtfime
```
